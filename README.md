## Finite Element Method for Poisson’s Equation

Final exam project for the numerical methods course. I am asked to implement robust code for Finite Elements Method in order to obtain a numerical solution of given Poisson’s Equation. Then I have to compare diﬀerent kind of preconditioning matrix for the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and ﬁnally I have to compare the numerical and analytical solution, expecting the numerical solution converging to the analytical one.
